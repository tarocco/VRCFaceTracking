# 👀 VRCFaceTracking LiveLink Module

This is a module for the VRCFaceTracking mod that enables you to use the FaceID sensors found on the IPhone X and newer to have face tracking with compatible avatars in VRChat desktop mode.

## 💾 Installation

Just drag the `VRCFT Module - LiveLink.dll` into your `Mods/VRCFTLibs` folder

## 🔧 Configuration

The default port is set to 11111, which is the port LiveLink will use by default. To change this, run the mod once to generate preferences, then change the `LiveLinkPort` preference under the `VRCFT LiveLink` category in the config file found at `UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg`.

## ▶ Usage

You need an IPhone X/XS/XR or newer, 12.9-inch IPad Pro 3rd gen or newer, or 11-inch IPad Pro 1st gen or newer to make use of this module.

- Install MelonLoader and the VRCFaceTracking mod
- Install this LiveLink module
- Install the app "[Live Link Face](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/live-link-face/id1495370836)" by Unreal Engine on your apple device
- Ensure that your apple device is connected to the same network as your computer
- Open Live Link Face on the apple device, and open settings, then tap Live Link at the top
- Add your computer's local IP address here, and set the port if needed
- Return to the main screen and make sure the Live button at the top is green
- Start VRChat in desktop mode, equip a VRCFT-enabled avatar, and enjoy facial tracking!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- Double check to make sure that your apple device and computer are connected to the same network
- Double check the IP address and port number entered in LiveLink match your computer's local IP address and that the port matches the one specified in the `UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg` file.
- Check that the IP address enetered is the local IP for the shared network, and not for any other networks your computer may be connected to (e.g. Hamachi)
- Ensure that your avatar supports VRCFT, and check in the toggles to make sure it is enabled
- Check your windows network settings, and ensure that the network is set as a private network

## 📜 Disclaimer

As with all VRChat mods, modifying the game client can result in account termination, be it temporary or permanent. While this mod doesn't ruin the experience for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.<br>
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**. I will not be held responsible for any punishments you may recieve for using this mod.

If you would like to bring your head movements into VR, and maybe hand movements as well with virtual controllers, check out [Driver4VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366950/Driver4VR/). I have also worked on a module for [opentrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) that allows you to utilize the head rotation data from LiveLink to move the virtual headset, though it is not yet published.
